 *NOTES: Return to the home location (or the nearest Rally Point if closer) and
 *then land. The home location is where the vehicle was last armed (or when it
 *first gets GPS lock after arming if the vehicle configuration allows this).
 *
 *This is the mission equivalent of the RTL flight mode.  The vehicle will
 *first climb to the RTL_ALT parameterâ€™s specified altitude (default is 15m)
 *before returning home.
 *
 *This command takes no parameters and generally should be the last command in
 *the mission.
